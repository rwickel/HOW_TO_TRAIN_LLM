"NOTE 1   For C2, a feasible test scenario in accordance with RESPONSE 3 (see Reference [4]) is accepted as adequate: “Practical testing experience revealed that a number of 20 valid data sets per scenario can supply a basic indication of validity”. If each of the 20 data sets complies with the pass-criteria for the test, a level of controllability of 85 % (with a level of confidence of 95 % which is generally accepted for human factors tests) can be proven. This is appropriate evidence of the rationale for a C2-estimate.  "
