Reference for single injuries (from AIS scale)  ,AIS 0 and less than 10 % probability of AIS 1-6; or  damage that cannot be classified safety-related  ,More than 10 % prob-ability of AIS 1-6 (and not S2 or S3)  ,More than 10 % probability of AIS 3-6  (and not S3)  ,More than 10 % prob-ability of AIS 5-6  
Examples  ,"— Bumps with roadside infrastructure   — Pushing over roadside    post, fence, etc.  — Light grazing damage   — Damage entering/    exiting parking space  — Leaving the road without collision or rollover    ","— Side impact with a narrow    stationary object,  e.g. passenger car crashing into a tree (impact to passenger cell)    with very low speed  — Rear/front collision with another passenger    car with very low speed  — Front collision (e.g. rear-ending       another vehicle, semi-trailer, etc.) without passenger compartment deformation  ","— Side impact with a narrow    stationary object, e.g. passenger car crashing into a tree (impact to passenger cell) with low speed  — Rear/front collision with another passenger car with low speed   — Pedestrian/    bicycle accident with low speed  ","— Side impact with a narrow    stationary object, e.g. passenger car crashing into a tree (impact to passenger cell) with medium speed  — Rear/front collision with another vehicle with medium speed   — Front collision (e.g. rear-ending       another vehicle, semi-trailer, etc.) with passenger compartment deformation  "
