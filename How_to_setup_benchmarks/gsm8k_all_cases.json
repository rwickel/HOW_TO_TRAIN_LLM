    "question": "Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
    "model_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Janet has ducks that lay eggs, and she sells the rest at the market. I need to figure out how much she makes each day. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. So, daily egg production is 16. Then she eats three eggs for breakfast every morning. Wait, but does that affect the number of eggs she sells? Hmm. The problem says she sells the remainder at the market. So, if she eats three eggs in the morning, does that mean she uses them up before selling? Or does she eat them in the morning and then have the rest for the day?\n\nWait, the problem says she eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. Hmm. Wait, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again.\n\nShe eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. Wait, maybe \"with four\" refers to the number of eggs she uses for the muffins? Or maybe it's a typo? Let me think.\n\nIf she bakes muffins every day with four, maybe she uses four eggs per day for muffins? Or maybe she uses four eggs in total? The wording is a bit unclear. But the problem says she sells the remainder at the farmers' market for $2 per fresh duck egg. So, the remainder after she uses three for breakfast and uses some for muffins. So, I need to figure out how many eggs she uses in total each day and then subtract that from the total eggs laid.\n\nSo, total eggs per day: 16.\n\nShe eats three for breakfast every morning. But does that mean she eats three eggs in the morning, and then uses some for muffins? Or is she eating three eggs in the morning and then using some for muffins?\n\nWait, the problem says she eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. So, maybe she uses three eggs for breakfast and four eggs for muffins? But that would be 3 + 4 = 7 eggs per day. But she has 16 eggs per day. So, the remainder would be 16 - 7 = 9 eggs. Then she sells those 9 eggs at the market for $2 per egg. So, 9 * 2 = $18. Is that the answer?\n\nBut let me check again. The problem says she \"bakes muffins for her friends every day with four.\" Maybe \"with four\" is indicating the number of eggs used for muffins? So, if she uses four eggs for muffins, then total eggs used is 3 (breakfast) + 4 (muffins) = 7. Then 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left. So, 9 * $2 = $18. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut wait, maybe the \"with four\" is a different meaning. Maybe she uses four eggs for muffins, but maybe the muffins require more? Or maybe she uses four eggs per muffin? But the problem says she bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. Maybe that's a typo, and it's supposed to say \"with four eggs\" or \"using four eggs\"? If it's \"with four,\" maybe she uses four eggs in total for muffins? But that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she uses four eggs for muffins each day, and she eats three eggs for breakfast. So, total eggs used is 3 + 4 = 7, remainder 9. So, 9 * $2 = $18. So, that would be the answer.\n\nBut let me check again. The problem says she eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. Maybe \"with four\" is indicating that she uses four eggs for the muffins. So, if she uses three eggs for breakfast and four for muffins, that's seven eggs. So, 16 - 7 = 9 eggs sold. So, 9 * $2 = $18. So, the answer is 18?\n\nWait, but maybe the muffins require more eggs? For example, if she bakes muffins with four eggs, maybe she uses four eggs per muffin? But the problem doesn't specify how many muffins she bakes. It just says she bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. Maybe that's a bit ambiguous. But since the problem says she sells the remainder at the market for $2 per fresh duck egg, and the only thing we know is that she uses three for breakfast and four for muffins. So, the total eggs used is 3 + 4 = 7. So, 16 - 7 = 9 eggs sold. 9 * 2 = 18. So, answer is 18.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the muffins are baked with four eggs, but she uses four eggs per day? So, if she bakes muffins every day with four eggs, that would be four eggs per day. Then, she eats three eggs for breakfast. So, total eggs used is 3 + 4 = 7, same as before. So, 16 - 7 = 9. 9 * 2 = 18.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"with four\" is not about the number of eggs, but about the number of muffins? Like, she bakes four muffins each day. But then, how many eggs does that require? If each muffin requires, say, one egg, then four muffins would require four eggs. But the problem doesn't specify. But since the problem says she sells the remainder at the market for $2 per fresh duck egg, and the only numbers given are 16 eggs per day, 3 for breakfast, and 4 for muffins. So, if we take \"with four\" as the number of eggs used for muffins, then 3 + 4 = 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"bakes muffins for her friends every day with four\" is a way of saying that she uses four eggs per day for muffins? So, 4 eggs for muffins, and 3 eggs for breakfast. So, 7 eggs total used. 16 - 7 = 9. 9 * 2 = 18. So, answer is 18.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that she eats three for breakfast, and then bakes muffins for her friends, which uses four eggs. So, total eggs used is 3 + 4 = 7. So, 16 - 7 = 9. 9 * 2 = 18.\n\nBut let me check if there's another interpretation. Maybe she eats three eggs for breakfast every morning, but that's per day? Wait, the problem says \"every morning\" so maybe she eats three eggs for breakfast each morning, but since she's doing this every day, does that mean she eats three eggs each morning, and then uses some for muffins? But the problem says she sells the remainder at the market. So, if she eats three eggs for breakfast, then she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left. Then she bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. If she uses four eggs for muffins, then 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left. So, 9 * 2 = 18. So, same answer.\n\nAlternatively, if she uses four eggs for muffins, but the muffins are baked every day, so maybe she uses four eggs each day for muffins, so 16 - 3 (breakfast) - 4 (muffins) = 9. So, same thing.\n\nSo, regardless of the interpretation, it seems that the answer is 18. Therefore, Janet makes $18 per day at the farmers' market.\n\nBut let me check again. Maybe the problem is that she eats three eggs for breakfast every morning, so that's three eggs per day? But if she eats three eggs for breakfast every morning, but does that mean she eats three eggs each morning, and then the rest is for the day? So, if she has 16 eggs per day, and she eats three for breakfast, then she has 13 left. Then she bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. So, if she uses four eggs for muffins, then she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left. So, 9 * $2 = $18. So, same answer.\n\nAlternatively, if she uses four eggs for muffins, but she eats three eggs for breakfast, so total eggs used is 3 + 4 = 7, so 16 - 7 = 9. So, same.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 18.\n\nBut let me check if there's a different way. Maybe the problem is that she eats three for breakfast every morning, but that's three eggs per day? So, 3 eggs per day for breakfast, and then she bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. So, if she uses four eggs for muffins, then 3 + 4 = 7, so 16 - 7 = 9. 9 * 2 = 18. So, same answer.\n\nAlternatively, if she uses four eggs for muffins, but the muffins are baked with four eggs, but maybe she uses four eggs per muffin? But the problem doesn't specify how many muffins she bakes, but since it's per day, maybe she bakes four muffins, each requiring one egg. So, 4 eggs for muffins. So, same as before.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 18. So, \\boxed{18}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{18}\n</think>\n\nTo determine how much Janet makes from selling her eggs at the farmers' market each day, we need to analyze the daily egg production and how many eggs she uses for breakfast and muffins.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Daily Egg Production\nJanet's ducks lay **16 eggs per day**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Determine How Many Eggs Are Used for Breakfast\nJanet eats **3 eggs for breakfast every morning**. Since this happens every day, we can assume she uses **3 eggs per day** for breakfast.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Determine How Many Eggs Are Used for Muffins\nThe problem states that Janet **bakes muffins for her friends every day with four**. This phrase suggests that she uses **4 eggs per day** for muffins.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Total Eggs Used Per Day\nTo find the number of eggs used for breakfast and muffins, we add the two quantities:\n\n$$\n\\text{Eggs used} = 3 \\text{ (breakfast)} + 4 \\text{ (muffins)} = 7 \\text{ eggs}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Number of Eggs Sold at the Market\nSubtract the eggs used from the total eggs produced:\n\n$$\n\\text{Eggs sold} = 16 \\text{ (total eggs)} - 7 \\text{ (used)} = 9 \\text{ eggs}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Calculate Revenue from Selling Eggs\nEach egg is sold for **$2**. Therefore, the total revenue from selling the eggs is:\n\n$$\n\\text{Revenue} = 9 \\text{ eggs} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/egg} = 18 \\text{ dollars}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{18}\n$$",

    "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
    "model_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem says a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. I need to find out how many bolts in total it takes. Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber. That part is straightforward. Now, the white fiber is mentioned as \"half that much.\" So, half of the blue fiber? Wait, half of 2 bolts? Let me make sure I understand. \n\nIf the blue fiber is 2 bolts, then the white fiber is half of that. So, half of 2 is 1. Therefore, the white fiber requires 1 bolt. So, total bolts would be blue plus white, which is 2 + 1 = 3 bolts. \n\nBut wait, let me check again. The problem says \"half that much white fiber.\" So, \"that much\" refers to the blue fiber. So, if the blue is 2 bolts, then the white is half of 2, which is 1. So total is 2 + 1 = 3. That seems right. \n\nBut maybe I need to think about it differently. Sometimes, when problems mention \"half that much,\" it can be ambiguous. But in this case, since it's specified as \"half that much white fiber,\" and \"that much\" refers to the blue fiber. So, yes, half of 2 is 1. \n\nAlternatively, if someone misreads it as half the amount of blue fiber, but that's the same thing. So, 2 bolts blue, 1 bolt white. Total 3. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's a trick here. Sometimes, problems can have hidden details. For example, maybe the \"half that much\" is referring to something else? Let me read again.\n\n\"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. How many bolts in total does it take?\"\n\nYes, so \"half that much white fiber.\" The \"that much\" is referring to the blue fiber. So, half of 2 is 1. So, white fiber is 1. Total is 2 + 1 = 3. \n\nAlternatively, if \"half that much\" was referring to the white fiber, but that wouldn't make sense because it's saying \"half that much white fiber,\" which would be half of the white fiber. But that would be a circular reference. So, no, the \"that much\" is referring to the blue fiber. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 3 bolts. \n\nBut just to make sure, let's think of it in equations. Let me assign variables.\n\nLet B = number of bolts of blue fiber = 2.\n\nLet W = number of bolts of white fiber.\n\nThe problem says \"half that much white fiber.\" So, \"that much\" is the blue fiber. So, W = (1/2) * B.\n\nSo, W = (1/2)*2 = 1.\n\nTherefore, total bolts = B + W = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the total number of bolts is 3. \n\nI don't see any other interpretation here. Unless there's a different way to read \"half that much.\" But in standard English, \"half that much\" would mean half of the amount that is \"that much.\" Since \"that much\" is the blue fiber, which is 2, half of that is 1. So, white is 1. Total is 3. \n\nAnother way to think: if you have 2 bolts of blue, and then half of that is white. So, 2 bolts blue, 1 bolt white. Total 3. \n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 3 bolts. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe total number of bolts is \\boxed{3}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the total number of bolts required for the robe, we begin by analyzing the given information:\n\n- The robe requires **2 bolts of blue fiber**.\n- The amount of **white fiber** required is **half that much**, i.e., half of the 2 bolts of blue fiber.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step Breakdown:\n\n1. **Blue Fiber Requirement:**  \n   The robe uses **2 bolts of blue fiber**.\n\n2. **White Fiber Requirement:**  \n   The problem states that the white fiber is **half that much**.  \n   Since the blue fiber is 2 bolts, half of that is:  \n   $$\n   \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 = 1 \\text{ bolt of white fiber}\n   $$\n\n3. **Total Bolts Required:**  \n   To find the total number of bolts, we add the blue and white fiber requirements:  \n   $$\n   2 \\text{ (blue)} + 1 \\text{ (white)} = 3 \\text{ bolts}\n   $$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{3}\n$$",

    "question": "Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?",
    "model_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Josh bought a house for $80,000 and then spent $50,000 on repairs. After doing those repairs, the value of the house increased by 150%. The question is asking how much profit he made. Hmm, profit usually means the total amount he gained after subtracting the cost. But I need to make sure I understand all the steps here.\n\nFirst, let me break down the information. The original price of the house is $80,000. Then he spends $50,000 on repairs. So, the total cost he incurred is $80,000 plus $50,000? Wait, but is the $50,000 part of the cost basis for calculating profit? Or is it just an expense that affects the value?\n\nWait, profit is typically calculated as the selling price minus the total cost. But here, the problem says he \"puts in $50,000 in repairs,\" which increased the value of the house by 150%. So, maybe we need to figure out the new value of the house after repairs, then subtract the original cost and the repair cost? Or is the profit just the increase in value?\n\nWait, let me think again. Profit can be calculated in different ways. If he sells the house, then profit is selling price minus total cost. But here, the problem is phrased as \"how much profit did he make?\" but it doesn't specify whether he sold it or not. Hmm. Wait, the problem says he \"tries flipping a house.\" Flipping usually means selling it. So maybe he sells it after the repairs? But the problem doesn't mention selling it. Wait, maybe we need to assume that he sells it? Or maybe the question is just asking about the profit from the repairs?\n\nWait, the problem says \"how much profit did he make?\" So maybe he made profit from the repairs? But that seems odd. Usually, profit is from selling the house. But maybe the question is just asking for the profit from the repairs? But that would be the increase in value. Wait, let me check the exact wording again.\n\n\"Josh decides to try flipping a house. He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs. This increased the value of the house by 150%. How much profit did he make?\"\n\nSo, the key here is that the value increased by 150%. So, if the original value was $80,000, then the value after repairs is $80,000 + 150% of $80,000. Let me calculate that.\n\n150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * 80,000 = 120,000. So the new value is 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000. So the value of the house is now $200,000.\n\nBut then, how much profit did he make? If he bought it for $80,000 and spent $50,000 on repairs, then the total cost is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000. But if he sells it for $200,000, then his profit would be $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000. So the profit is $70,000.\n\nBut let me check if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the repair cost as part of the cost basis, so the total cost is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000. Then the selling price is $200,000, so profit is $70,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the profit is just the increase in value, which is $120,000. But that seems less likely because profit is usually the total amount gained, which would be the selling price minus total cost. But the problem says \"how much profit did he make,\" so I think it's referring to the total profit, which would be selling price minus total cost. But the problem doesn't mention selling it. Wait, maybe he didn't sell it? But the question is about profit, which would require a sale.\n\nWait, maybe the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the original problem again.\n\n\"Josh decides to try flipping a house. He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs. This increased the value of the house by 150%. How much profit did he make?\"\n\nHmm. If he just put in the repairs and the value increased by 150%, but didn't sell it, then profit would be zero? But that doesn't make sense. So, probably, the question is assuming that he sold the house after the repairs. Therefore, the profit is the selling price minus total cost. So, the selling price is the original value plus 150% of original value, which is 200,000. The total cost is 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000. Therefore, profit is 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000.\n\nBut let me check another way. Maybe the problem is considering that the repairs are part of the cost basis. So, the cost basis is the original price plus the repairs. So, if he bought the house for 80k, then spent 50k on repairs, so total cost basis is 130k. Then, the value is 200k, so profit is 200k - 130k = 70k. So same answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the value increased by 150%, so the profit is 150% of the original value. But that would be 120k, but that's not profit. Profit is usually the total amount gained, so if you have a total value of 200k, and you paid 130k, then profit is 70k. So I think that's the answer.\n\nBut let me check if the value increased by 150% from the original price. So original price is 80k. 150% of 80k is 120k. So the new value is 80k + 120k = 200k. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, profit is 200k - 130k = 70k. So the answer is $70,000. Therefore, the profit is $\\boxed{70000}$.\n\nBut let me make sure there isn't another interpretation. For example, sometimes in some contexts, profit is calculated as the increase in value, but that would be 120k, but that's not standard. Profit is usually the total amount you get from selling minus the total cost. So unless the question is specifically asking for the increase in value, which is 120k, but the question says \"how much profit did he make,\" which is more likely to be the total profit, which is 70k.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the repair cost is part of the cost basis, so the total cost is 80k + 50k = 130k. Then the selling price is 200k, so profit is 70k. Yes, that seems right.\n\nAnother way: if the value increased by 150%, then the value is 200k. If he had just kept the house, he would have had 80k. But he spent 50k on repairs, so the profit is 200k - 80k - 50k = 70k. So same answer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 70,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe profit Josh made is \\boxed{70000}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how much profit Josh made, we need to carefully analyze the situation step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Initial Cost**\n\nJosh buys a house for **$80,000**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Understand the Repairs and Their Impact**\n\nHe spends **$50,000** on repairs. These repairs increase the **value of the house by 150%**.\n\nTo find the new value of the house after the repairs:\n\n$$\n\\text{Increase in value} = 150\\% \\times 80,000 = 1.5 \\times 80,000 = 120,000\n$$\n\n$$\n\\text{New value of the house} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Determine Total Cost**\n\nJosh's **total cost** includes both the original purchase price and the repair cost:\n\n$$\n\\text{Total cost} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate Profit**\n\nProfit is calculated as the **selling price minus total cost**. Assuming Josh sells the house after the repairs, the selling price is the new value of the house, which is **$200,000**.\n\n$$\n\\text{Profit} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n$$\n\\boxed{70000}\n$$",

    "question": "James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week.  He runs 60 meters each sprint.  How many total meters does he run a week?",
    "model_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. James runs 3 sprints three times a week. Each sprint is 60 meters. I need to find out how many total meters he runs in a week. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many sprints he does in a week. The problem says he runs 3 sprints 3 times a week. Wait, so 3 sprints each time he runs? Or is it 3 sprints in total each week? Let me read it again: \"James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week.\" Hmm, that wording is a bit confusing. Does it mean he runs 3 sprints each week, or 3 sprints three times a week? \n\nWait, maybe it's 3 sprints each time he runs, and he runs that 3 times a week. So, if he runs 3 sprints each time, and he does this 3 times a week, then total sprints would be 3 times 3? Or is it 3 sprints per week? Let me think.\n\nThe original question says: \"James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week.\" So, maybe it's 3 sprints each time he runs, and he runs that 3 times a week. So, 3 sprints per run, and he does 3 runs a week. Therefore, total sprints per week would be 3 times 3? Or is it 3 sprints per week? Wait, maybe the wording is that he runs 3 sprints 3 times a week. So, 3 sprints each time he runs, and he runs 3 times a week. So, 3 sprints * 3 runs = 9 sprints per week? But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe it's 3 sprints each week, 3 times a week? That would be 3 sprints per week. But the wording is a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, let me check again. The original problem says: \"James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week.\" So, \"run 3 sprints 3 times a week.\" So, maybe it's 3 sprints each time he runs, and he runs 3 times a week. So, 3 sprints * 3 runs = 9 sprints per week. Then, each sprint is 60 meters, so total meters would be 9 sprints * 60 meters. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's 3 sprints in total, and he does that 3 times a week. So, 3 sprints * 3 times = 9 sprints per week. Either way, same result. So, 9 sprints. Then 9 * 60 meters. Let me check that again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that he runs 3 sprints each week, and that's done 3 times a week? That doesn't make much sense. Wait, maybe the problem is phrased as \"3 sprints 3 times a week,\" meaning that he runs 3 sprints each time he runs, and he runs 3 times a week. So, 3 sprints per run, 3 runs a week. So, total sprints: 3 * 3 = 9. Each sprint is 60 meters, so total meters: 9 * 60. \n\nAlternatively, if it's 3 sprints 3 times a week, meaning 3 sprints each time he runs, and he runs 3 times a week, so 3 sprints * 3 runs = 9 sprints. So, same thing. So, 9 * 60 = 540 meters. \n\nBut let me make sure. Let's think of it as 3 sprints per run, and he does this 3 times a week. So, each week, he has 3 runs, each with 3 sprints. So, 3 runs * 3 sprints = 9 sprints. 9 * 60 meters = 540 meters. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem was \"James runs 3 sprints 3 times a week,\" meaning he runs 3 sprints each time, and he does that 3 times a week. So, 3 sprints * 3 times = 9 sprints. So, same answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that he runs 3 sprints each week, and that's done 3 times a week. But that would be 3 sprints * 3 = 9 sprints. So, same thing. \n\nSo, regardless of how I interpret it, it seems like 9 sprints. 9 * 60 meters. 9*60 is 540. So, 540 meters. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way. Maybe the problem is that he runs 3 sprints 3 times a week. So, 3 sprints each time, and he does this 3 times a week. So, 3 sprints * 3 times = 9 sprints. 9*60=540. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that he runs 3 sprints each week, and that's done 3 times a week. But that would be 3 sprints * 3 = 9 sprints. So, same answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that he runs 3 sprints 3 times a week. So, 3 sprints each time, and 3 times a week. So, 3*3=9. \n\nYes, so regardless, it's 9 sprints. 9*60=540. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that he runs 3 sprints each week, and that's 3 times a week. So, 3 sprints * 3 = 9. So, same thing. \n\nTherefore, the total meters he runs a week is 540. \n\nBut just to make sure, let's think of it in another way. If he runs 3 sprints each time, and he runs 3 times a week, then each week he does 3*3=9 sprints. Each sprint is 60 meters. So, 9*60=540. \n\nAlternatively, if he runs 3 sprints 3 times a week, meaning that each of the 3 times he runs 3 sprints. So, 3*3=9 sprints. \n\nYes. So, the answer is 540 meters. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 540, so \\boxed{540}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe total meters James runs a week is \\boxed{540}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many total meters James runs in a week, we need to break down the given information step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Given Information\n\n- **Number of sprints per run**: 3\n- **Number of runs per week**: 3\n- **Distance per sprint**: 60 meters\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Total Number of Sprints Per Week\n\nSince James runs 3 sprints **each time** and he runs 3 times a week, we multiply the number of sprints per run by the number of runs:\n\n$$\n3 \\text{ sprints/run} \\times 3 \\text{ runs/week} = 9 \\text{ sprints/week}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Total Distance Per Week\n\nEach sprint is 60 meters, so the total distance he runs in a week is:\n\n$$\n9 \\text{ sprints} \\times 60 \\text{ meters/sprint} = 540 \\text{ meters}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{540}\n$$",

    "question": "Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy.  She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?",
    "model_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Wendi feeds her chickens every day, and she gives them three meals a day. The problem is asking how many cups of feed she needs in the final meal. The flock has 20 chickens. \n\nFirst, let me parse the information given. Each chicken gets three cups of mixed feed each day. But the feed is divided into three meals. The first meal in the morning is 15 cups, and the afternoon is 25 cups. The question is about the final meal. \n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I understand. If each chicken gets three cups of feed per day, and there are 20 chickens, then the total amount of feed per day for the entire flock would be 20 chickens multiplied by 3 cups. Let me calculate that. 20 times 3 is 60 cups. So, in a day, the total feed needed is 60 cups. \n\nBut the feed is divided into three meals: morning, afternoon, and final meal. The morning is 15 cups, afternoon is 25 cups. So, the total for the first two meals is 15 + 25 = 40 cups. Therefore, the final meal would be the remaining amount. \n\nSo, total feed per day is 60 cups. Subtract the morning and afternoon feed: 60 - 40 = 20 cups. So, the final meal would be 20 cups? \n\nWait, but the problem says \"In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.\" So, the total for the first two meals is 15 + 25 = 40 cups. Then the final meal is 60 - 40 = 20 cups. \n\nBut let me check again. Maybe I need to think about how much each chicken gets per meal. Wait, the problem says \"Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed...\" So, each chicken gets three cups per day. But the feed is divided into three meals. So, maybe the total per meal is different? \n\nWait, but the problem says \"In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.\" So, the morning meal is 15 cups for the entire flock. Then afternoon is 25 cups. So, the total for the entire day is 15 + 25 + X, where X is the final meal. \n\nBut if each chicken gets three cups per day, then total feed per day is 20 chickens * 3 cups = 60 cups. Therefore, 15 + 25 + X = 60. So, X = 60 - 40 = 20. So, the final meal is 20 cups. \n\nBut maybe the problem is trying to trick me? Let me check again. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the feed is divided into three meals, but the amount given per meal is per chicken? Or per the entire flock? \n\nThe problem says \"In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.\" So, that's the entire flock. So, the morning meal is 15 cups for all 20 chickens. Then the afternoon is 25 cups for all 20 chickens. Then the final meal is X cups for all 20 chickens. \n\nTherefore, total is 15 + 25 + X = 60. So X = 20. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 20 cups. \n\nBut let me check once more. Maybe the problem is that the feed is given in three separate meals, but each chicken gets three cups per day. So, if each chicken gets three cups, then per meal, how much does each chicken get? \n\nBut the problem says \"In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.\" So, the total for the morning meal is 15 cups for all chickens. Therefore, each chicken gets 15 cups divided by 20 chickens. That would be 15/20 cups per chicken. Similarly, the afternoon meal is 25 cups for all chickens, so 25/20 cups per chicken. Then the final meal is X cups for all chickens, so X/20 cups per chicken. \n\nBut then, since each chicken gets three cups per day, we can set up the equation: \n\n15/20 + 25/20 + X/20 = 3 \n\nMultiply both sides by 20: \n\n15 + 25 + X = 60 \n\nWhich again gives X = 20. \n\nSo, same result. Therefore, the final meal is 20 cups. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 20. \n\nBut let me check if there's another interpretation. For example, maybe the 15 cups and 25 cups are per chicken? But the problem says \"In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.\" So, \"flock\" is plural, so it's the entire flock. So, 15 cups for the entire flock. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had said \"each chicken gets 15 cups in the morning,\" but that would be different. But in this case, it's \"she gives her flock... 15 cups of feed.\" So, total for the flock. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 20. \n\nBut just to make sure, let's think of another way. Suppose she gives 15 cups in the morning, 25 in the afternoon, and X in the final meal. \n\nTotal is 15 + 25 + X = 60. So, X = 20. \n\nYes. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem was about per chicken, but the problem says \"each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy.\" So, each chicken gets 3 cups per day. \n\nTherefore, total per day is 20 * 3 = 60. \n\nSo, the three meals add up to 60. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 20. \n\nI think that's solid. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{20}\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, let's break down the information step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate Total Daily Feed Requirement**\n\nWendi feeds each of her 20 chickens **3 cups of mixed chicken feed** every day. Therefore, the total amount of feed required for the entire flock is:\n\n$$\n20 \\text{ chickens} \\times 3 \\text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \\text{ cups}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Determine Feed Given in the First Two Meals**\n\nFrom the problem, we are told:\n\n- In the **morning**, Wendi gives **15 cups** of feed.\n- In the **afternoon**, she gives **25 cups** of feed.\n\nSo, the total feed given in the first two meals is:\n\n$$\n15 + 25 = 40 \\text{ cups}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate Final Meal Feed**\n\nSince the total daily feed is 60 cups, and 40 cups have already been given in the morning and afternoon, the remaining amount for the final meal is:\n\n$$\n60 - 40 = 20 \\text{ cups}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n$$\n\\boxed{20}\n$$",
