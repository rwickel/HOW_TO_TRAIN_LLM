Absolute Zero Paradigm. Supervised learning relies on human-curated reasoning traces for behavior cloning. Reinforcement\nlearning from verified rewards, enables agents to self-learn reasoning, but still depends on expert-defined learning distribution and a\nrespective set of curated QA pairs, demanding domain expertise and manual effort. In contrast, we introduce a new paradigm, Absolute\nZero, for training reasoning models without any human-curated data. We envision that the agent should autonomously propose tasks\noptimized for learnability and learn how to solve them using an unified model. The agent learns by interacting with an environment that\nprovides verifiable feedback, enabling reliable and continuous self-improvement entirely without human intervention.\n1. Introduction\nLarge language models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable improvements in reasoning capabilities by employing Reinforcement\nLearning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) (Lambert et al., 2024). Unlike methods that explicitly imitate intermediate reasoning steps,\nRLVR uses only outcome-based feedback, enabling large-scale reinforcement learning over vast task datasets (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025;\nTeam et al., 2025; Jaech et al., 2024; OpenAI, 2025b;a). A particularly compelling variant is the “zero” RLVR paradigm (DeepSeek-AI\net al., 2025), which forgoes any cold-start distillation data, using neither human-generated nor AI-generated reasoning traces, and applies\nRLVR directly on the base model with task rewards. However, these methods still depend heavily on expertly curated distributions of\nreasoning question–answer pairs, which raises serious concerns about their long-term scalability (Villalobos et al., 2024). As reasoning\nmodels continue to advance, the effort required to construct large-scale, high-quality datasets may soon become unsustainable (Yue\net al., 2025). A similar scalability bottleneck has already been identified in the domain of LLM pretraining (Sutskever et al., 2024).\nFurthermore, as AI systems continue to evolve and potentially exceed human intellect, an exclusive dependence on human-designed\ntasks risks imposing constraints on their capacity for autonomous learning and growth (Hughes et al., 2024). This underscores the need\nfor a new paradigm that begins to explore possibilities beyond the constraints of human-designed tasks and prepares for a future in which\nAI systems may surpass human intelligence.\nTo this end, we propose “Absolute Zero”, a new paradigm for reasoning models in which the model simultaneously learns to define tasks\nthat maximize learnability and to solve them effectively, enabling self-evolution through self-play without relying on external data. In\ncontrast to prior self-play methods that are limited to narrow domains, fixed functionalities, or learned reward models that are prone to\nhacking (Silver et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2025; 2024), the Absolute Zero paradigm is designed to operate in open-ended settings while\nremaining grounded in a real environment. It relies on feedback from the environment as a verifiable source of reward, mirroring how\nhumans learn and reason through interaction with the world, and helps prevent issues such as hacking with neural reward models (Hughes\net al., 2024). Similar to AlphaZero (Silver et al., 2017), which improves through self-play, our proposed paradigm requires no human\nsupervision and learns entirely through self-interaction. We believe the Absolute Zero paradigm represents a promising step toward\nenabling large language models to autonomously achieve superhuman reasoning capabilities.\nBuilding on this new reasoning paradigm, we introduce the Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR), which proposes and solves coding tasks. We\ncast code executor as an open-ended yet grounded environment, sufficient to both validate task integrity and also provide verifiable\nfeedback for stable training. We let AZR construct three types of coding tasks: infer and reason about one particular element in a\nprogram, input, output triplet, which corresponds to three complementary modes of reasoning: induction, abduction, and deduction. We\ntrain the entire system end-to-end with a newly proposed reinforcement learning advantage estimator tailored to the multitask nature of\nthe proposed approach.\nDespite being trained entirely without any in-distribution data, AZR demonstrates remarkable capabilities across diverse reasoning tasks\nin math and coding. In mathematics, AZR achieves competitive performance compared to zero reasoner models explicitly fine-tuned\nwith domain-specific supervision. In coding tasks, AZR establishes a new state-of-the-art performance, surpassing models specifically\ntrained with code datasets using RLVR. Furthermore, AZR outperforms all previous models by an average of 1.8 absolute points\n2",

These surprising results highlight that general reasoning skills\ncan emerge without human-curated domain targeted data, positioning Absolute Zero as an promising research direction and AZR as a\nfirst pivotal milestone. Besides the remarkable results AZR achieved with zero human data for reasoning, we also make very interesting\nfindings summarized below:\n• Code priors amplify reasoning. The base Qwen-Coder-7b model started with math performance 3.6 points lower than Qwen-7b.\nBut after AZR training for both models, the coder variant surpassed the base by 0.7 points, suggesting that strong coding capabilities\nmay potentially amplify overall reasoning improvements after AZR training.\n• Cross domain transfer is more pronounced for AZR. After RLVR, expert code models raise math accuracy by only 0.65 points on\naverage, whereas AZR-Base-7B and AZR-Coder-7B trained on self-proposed code reasoning tasks improve math average by 10.9 and\n15.2, respectively, demonstrating much stronger generalized reasoning capability gains.\n• Bigger bases yield bigger gains. Performance improvements scale with model size: the 3B, 7B, and 14B coder models gain +5.7,\n+10.2, and +13.2 points respectively, suggesting continued scaling is advantageous for AZR.\n• Comments as intermediate plans emerge naturally. When solving code induction tasks, AZR often interleaves step-by-step plans\nas comments and code (Appendix C.3), resembling the ReAct prompting framework (Yao et al., 2023). Similar behavior has been\nobserved in much larger formal-math models such as DeepSeek Prover v2 (671B) (Ren et al., 2025). We therefore believe that allowing\nthe model to use intermediate scratch-pads when generating long-form answers may be beneficial in other domains as well.\n• Cognitive Behaviors and Token length depends on reasoning mode. Distinct cognitive behaviors—such as step-by-step reasoning,\nenumeration, and trial-and-error all emerged through AZR training, but different behaviors are particularly evident across different\ntypes of tasks. Furthermore token counts grow over AZR training, but the magnitude of increase also differs by task types: abduction\ngrows the most because the model performs trial-and-error until output matches, whereas deduction and induction grow modestly.\n• Safety alarms ringing. We observe AZR with Llama3.1-8b occasionally produces concerning chains of thought, we term the\n“uh-oh moment”, example shown in Figure 32, highlighting the need for future work on safety-aware training (Zhang et al., 2025a).\n2. The Absolute Zero Paradigm\n2.1. Preliminaries\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT).\nSFT requires the datasets of task-rationale-answer demonstrations D = {(x, c⋆, y⋆)}, where\nx is the query, c⋆is the gold chain-of-thought (CoT)) and y⋆is the gold answer, all provided by human experts or superior AI models.\nThe model trains to imitate the reference responses to minimize the conditional negative log-likelihood (Ouyang et al., 2022):\nLSFT(θ) = −E(x,c⋆,y⋆)∼D log πθ\n\u0000c⋆, y⋆| x).\n(1)\nHowever, at the frontier level, there’s no stronger model to distill from, and expert human labeling doesn’t scale well.\nReinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR).\nTo move beyond the limits of pure imitation, RLVR only\nrequires a dataset of task and answer D = {(x, y⋆)}, without labeled rationale. RLVR allows the model to generate its own CoT and\ncalculate a verifiable reward with the golden answer r(y, y⋆). However, the learning task distribution D, with its set of queries and gold\nanswers are still labeled by human experts. The trainable policy πθ is optimized to maximize expected reward:\nJRLVR(θ) = E(x,y⋆)∼D, y∼πθ(· |x)\n\u0002\nr(y, y⋆)\u0003\n.\n(2)\nIn summary, both SFT and RLVR still rely on human-curated datasets of either queries, demonstrations, or verifiers, which ultimately\nlimit scalability. The Absolute Zero paradigm removes this dependency by allowing the model to generate, solve, and learn from its own\ninteractions with the environment entirely through self-play.\n2.2. Absolute Zero\nWe propose the Absolute Zero paradigm, where during training, the model simultaneously proposes tasks, solves them, and learns from\nboth stages. No external data is required and the model learns entirely through self-play and experience, aided by some environment. We\nillustrate this paradigm in Figure 2, which contrasts Absolute Zero with supervised learning and RLVR, highlighting how our approach\neliminates the need for any human-curated data by enabling self-improving task proposal and solution through self-play.\nTo make the Absolute Zero setting concrete, we now define how one model can act both as the proposer and solver role. To aid\nunderstanding, we include an illustration in Figure 3. Let πθ be our parameterized language model, it is used to play two roles, proposer\nπpropose\nθ\nand solver πsolve\nθ\nduring training.\n3",

The Absolute Zero Loop. The Absolute Zero loop begins with the agent π\nproposing task τ, which is transformed by f with the environment e into a validated\nproblem (x, y⋆), and also emits a reward rpropose for learnability. Then, a standard RL step\nfollows: the agent solves x by producing y, receiving reward rsolve from e by matching\nwith y⋆. πpropose and πsolve are jointly trained and this process can be repeated indefinitely.\nThe proposer first samples a proposed\ntask conditioned on variable z:\nτ\n∼\nπpropose\nθ\n(·|z), which will then be validated\nand used to construct a valid reasoning task\ntogether with the environment e: (x, y⋆) ∼\nfe(·|τ), where x is the task query and y⋆\nis the gold label. Then the solver produces\nan answer y ∼πsolve\nθ\n( · | x). Each pro-\nposed task τ is scored by a learnability\nreward rpropose\ne\n(τ, πθ), which captures the\nexpected improvement in πθ after train-\ning on the task query x. Moreover, the\nsame policy also receives a solution re-\nward rsolve\ne\n(y, y⋆) for its answer to the task\nquery x, with the environment again serv-\ning as the verifier. A nonnegative coefficient λ balances the trade-off between exploring new, learnable tasks and improving the model’s\nreasoning and problem-solving abilities. We formally define the absolute zero setting’s objective as follows:\nJ (θ) := max\nθ\nEz∼p(z)\n\"\nE(x,y⋆)∼fe(·|τ),τ∼πpropose\nθ\n(·|z)\n\u0014\nrpropose\ne\n(τ, πθ) + λ Ey∼πsolve\nθ\n(·|x)\n\u0002\nrsolve\ne\n(y, y⋆)\u0003\u0015#\n.\n(3)\nNotice that we shift the burden of scaling data away from human experts and onto the proposer policy πpropose\nθ\nand the environment\ne. These two roles are both responsible for defining/evolving the learning task distribution, validating proposed tasks, and providing\ngrounded feedback that supports stable and self-sustainable training. When proposing, z acts as a conditional variable that seeds\ngeneration of tasks. Practically, z can be instantiated by sampling a small subset of past (task, answer) pairs from a continually updated\ntask memory, yet there is no specific implementation tied to the paradigm. To guide the proposing process, we use a learnability reward\nrpropose(τ, πθ), which measures how much the model is expected to improve by solving a proposed task τ. Moreover, the solver reward\nrsolve(y, y∗) evaluates the correctness of the model’s output. Together, these two signals guide the model to propose tasks that are both\nchallenging and learnable, while also enhancing its reasoning abilities, ultimately enabling continuous improvement through self-play.\n3. Absolute Zero Reasoner\nIn this section, we present Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR) as the first attempt to embrace the Absolute Zero Paradigm. In AZR, an\nunified LLM serves as both a proposer and a solver: it generates tasks to evolve its learning curriculum and attempts to solve them\nto improve its reasoning capabilities. The model is trained jointly with both roles, learning to create tasks that push the boundary of\nreasoning capacity while enhancing its ability to solve them effectively (Section 3.1). Within this self-play training paradigm, the model\nlearns from three distinct type of coding tasks, which corresponding to three fundamental modes of reasoning: abduction, deduction and\ninduction (Section 3.2). Using coding tasks is motivated by the Turing-completeness of programming languages (Stuart, 2015) and\nempirical evidence that code-based training improves reasoning (Aryabumi et al., 2024). We adopt code as an open-ended, expressive,\nand verifiable medium for enabling reliable task construction and verification (Section 3.3). Finally, the model is updated using a newly\nproposed advantage estimator designed for multitask learning (Section 3.3.5). We outline the overall algorithm in Algorithm 1 and\nhighlight an illustration of our Absolute Zero Reasoner approach in Figure 4. To expedite future exploration in this area, we also present\nseveral attempts that did not yield fruitful results but still warrant discussion in Appendix D.\n3.1. Two Roles in One: Proposer and Solver\nLarge language models are naturally suited for implementing AZR in a multitask learning context (Radford et al., 2019), as both\nthe formulation of reasoning tasks and their solutions occur within a unified language space. To this end, we propose rewarding a\nsingle model for both generating high learning potential tasks and solving them effectively, as specified by the Absolute Zero objective\nin Equation (3). At each iteration of the online rollout, AZR proposes new reasoning tasks by conditioning on the task type (as defined\nin Section 3.2) and K past self-generated examples. The model is explicitly prompted to generate tasks that differ from these examples,\npromoting diversity and broader coverage of the task space. These task proposals are filtered and transformed into valid reasoning\ntasks that can be verified using the environment, outlined later in Section 3.3. AZR then attempts to solve these newly proposed tasks,\nreceiving grounded feedback for its model responses. Both task proposal and problem solving are trained using reinforcement learning.\nWe now outline the rewards used for each role.\nReward Design.\nPrior work has shown that setting appropriate task difficulty is critical for promoting effective learning in reasoning\nsystems (Zeng et al., 2025b). Motivated by this, we design a reward function for the proposer that encourages generation of tasks\n4",

Absolute Zero Reasoner Training Overview. At every iteration, Absolute Zero Reasoner first PROPOSES a batch of tasks,\nconditioned on past self-generated triplets stored in a buffer and a particular task type: abduction, deduction, or induction (Section 3.2).\nFrom these generated tasks, Python is used to filter and construct valid code-based reasoning questions. A learnability reward rpropose is\nalso calculated for each proposed task as defined in Equation (4). The Absolute Zero Reasoner then SOLVES the batch of reasoning\nquestions. Python is used again to verify the generated responses and compute the accuracy reward rsolve as described in Equation (5).\nFinally, the Absolute Zero Reasoner is jointly updated using both rpropose and rsolve across all three task types, using TRR++ (Section 3.3.5).\nwith meaningful learning potential—neither too easy nor unsolvable for the current solver. Concretely, we use the same language\nmodel in its solver role to estimate the learnability of a proposed task, a similar type of reward used in unsupervised environment\ndesign literature (Sukhbaatar et al., 2018). We perform n Monte Carlo rollouts of the solver and compute the average success rate:\n¯rsolve = 1\nn\nPN\ni=1 r(i)\nsolve. The proposer’s reward is then defined as:\nrpropose =\n\u001a\n0,\nif ¯rsolve = 0 or ¯rsolve = 1\n1 −¯rsolve,\notherwise,\n(4)\nThe intuition is that if a task is either trivial to solve (¯rsolve = 1) or unsolvable (¯rsolve = 0), the task provides little to no learning signal\nfor the proposer. In contrast, tasks of moderate difficulty, where the solver occasionally succeeds are rewarded the most, as they offer the\nrichest feedback and greatest potential for learning.\nFor the solver, we assign a simple binary reward based on the correctness of its final output,\nrsolve = I(y=y⋆),\n(5)\nwhere y⋆is the ground-truth answer, and equality is evaluated based on value equality in Python.\nWith the primary rewards for the proposing and solving roles defined, we adopt the following composite reward structure, which\nintegrates rpropose and rsolve with a format-aware penalty inspired by DeepSeek-AI et al. (2025):\nR(yπ) =\n\n\n\nrrole\nif the response is passable, role ∈{propose,solve}\n−0.5\nif the response is wrong but well-formatted,\n−1\nif the answer has formatting errors,\n(6)\nwhere yπ is the response of the language model. The main format that the proposing and solving tasks need to follow is the DeepSeek\nR1 <think> and <answer> format, as shown in Figure 33. Moreover, for the proposer, the reward criterion for format goes beyond\nsimply following the XML structure. As detailed in Section 3.3.3, only responses that produce valid triplets and pass the filtering stage\nare considered to be correctly formatted.\n5",

Task Proposal Inputs and Buffer Management\nDuring the actual self-play stage of AZR, we use the task buffer in three ways. First, for the proposer of abduction and deduction tasks,\nwe uniformly sample K past triplets from the buffer, present them as in-context examples to the proposer and let it generate a new task.\nThe design is to show it past examples, and prompt it to generate a different one to promote diversity (Zhao et al., 2025a). Second, we\nsample one triplet from the union of abduction and deduction buffers Dabd\nS Dded, and present the program p from that triplet to the\ninduction proposer to generate a set of N matching inputs {in} and a natural language message m. Lastly, to maintain stable training, if\na batch of solver problems contains fewer than B valid proposed tasks (proposer not adhering to formatting), we fill the remainder by\nuniformly sampling from the corresponding task buffer of previously validated triplets.\nThe buffer grows for abduction and deduction tasks whenever π propose a valid triplet (p, i, o), regardless if it gets any task reward.\nSimilarly, for induction tasks, all valid triplets (p, {in, on}), m are added to the buffer.\n3.3.3. Constructing Valid Tasks\nProposal Task Validation. We first describe how we construct valid tasks from the proposals generated by the policy π. For deduction\nand abduction tasks, each proposal consists of a program and an input (p, i). To validate the task, we use the task validation procedure\n(steps shown below) on the input to obtain the correct output o, resulting in a complete triplet (p, i, o). For induction tasks, given a\nprogram p the policy proposes a set of inputs {in} and message m. We also use the task validation procedure on each of the input in\nin the set to obtain a corresponding output on, forming a set of input-output pairs {in, on}. We do not impose any constraints on m.\nThe resulting task is considered valid only when all inputs yield valid outputs and the formatting requirements are satisfied. The task\nvalidation procedure entails:\n1. Program Integrity. We first use Python to run the program p with the input i. If no errors are raised and something is returned, we\nthen gather the output o of that (p, i) pair and determine that the program at least has valid syntax.\n2. Program Safety. We also check whether a program is safe for execution by restricting the use of certain sensitive packages that might\ncause harm to the Python environment, i.e., os.sys, sys, shutil. The list of packages used to filter out invalid programs is\nprovided in Figure 8. This list is also included in the instructions when prompting the language model to generate questions. See\nFigures 34 to 36.\n3. Check for Determinism. In our setting, we only consider deterministic programs, i.e., p ∈Pdeterministic ⊂P, where P is the space\nof all valid programs and I is the space of all valid inputs:\n7",

That is, for all inputs i, the output of p(i) remains identical\nwith any independent execution of the program. A valid program/input/output triplet (p, i, o) is defined such that o = p(i), where\np ∈Pdeterministic.\nSince the output of probabilistic programs can vary on every individual run, it is non-trivial to use verifiable functions to evaluate the\ncorrectness of an answer. Therefore, to keep the verifier simple, we restrict the valid programs generated by the learner to the class\nof deterministic programs. We believe that stochastic programs can encompass a larger class of behaviors and are important and\npromising to include in future versions of AZR.\nTo implement the filtering of invalid probabilistic programs, and following the definition of a deterministic program highlighted in\nEquation (7), we approximate this procedure by independently running the program j finite times and checking that all the outputs\nare equal. For computational budget reasons, we fixed j = 2 for all experiments.\nSolving Task Construction. If a task proposal passes these three checks, we deem it a valid task and apply appropriate procedures to\npresent part of the triplet to the solver. Specifically, we set x = (p, i) for deduction; x = (p, o) for abduction; and x = ({in, on}N//2\nn=1 , m)\nfor induction, where half of the tests cases and a program description m is used. We use all valid tasks from timestep t; if the batch B is\nnot full, we uniformly sample from previously validated tasks to fill the batch.\n3.3.4. Answer Verification\nFor abduction task, we receive iπ from the solver policy, then we equivalence match using p(iπ) = p(i⋆), where ∗refers to the\nprivileged gold information. The reason we do not just match iπ and i⋆is because p is not necessarily bĳective. For deduction task, we\nmatch oπ = o⋆. For induction, we match all({pπ(i⋆\nn) = o⋆\nn}N). This part might be convoluted to explain in language, therefore we\nrecommend the reader to see how we did abduction, deduction and induction verification in code in Figures 10 to 12, respectively.\n3.3.5. Task-Relative REINFORCE++\nSince AZR trains the combination of roles and task types, it operates in a multitask reinforcement learning setup (Zhang & Yang, 2021;\nZhao et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023; Yue et al., 2023). Instead of computing a single global baseline as in REINFORCE++ (Hu, 2025)\n(Appendix A), we compute separate baselines for each of the six task-role configurations. This can be viewed as an interpolation between\nper-question baselines, as in GRPO (Shao et al., 2024), and a global baseline, allowing for more structured variance reduction tailored to\neach task setup. We refer to this variant as Task-Relative REINFORCE++ (TRR++). The normalized advantage Anorm is computed as:\nAnorm\ntask,role = r −µtask,role\nσtask,role\n,\ntask ∈{ind,ded,abd}, role ∈{propose,solve},\n(8)\nwhere the mean and standard deviation are computed within each task type and role, yielding six baselines.\n4. Experiments\n4.1. Experiment Setup\nTraining Details.\nFor all experiments, we initialize the buffers as described in Section 3.1. AZR models are trained using a batch\nsize of 64 × 6 (2 roles × 3 task types). We use constant learning rate= 1e−6 and the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019).\nComplete list of hyperparameters is provided in Table 3.\nFor the main experiments,\nwe train AZR models on Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-7B-Coder,\nresulting in Absolute\nZero Reasoner-base-7B and Absolute Zero Reasoner-Coder-7B, respectively.\nAdditional experiments include training\nQwen2.5-Coder-3B, Qwen2.5-Coder-14B, Qwen2.5-14B, Llama-3.1-8B (Yang et al., 2024a; Hui et al., 2024; Dubey et al.,\n2024).\nEvaluation Protocol.\nTo evaluate our models, we divide the datasets into in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD)\ncategories. For OOD benchmarks, which we emphasize more, we further categorize them into coding and mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks. For coding tasks, we evaluate using Evalplus (Liu et al., 2023) on the HumanEval+ and MBPP+ benchmarks, as\nwell as LiveCodeBench Generation (v1-5, May 23-Feb 25) (Jain et al., 2024). For mathematical reasoning, we utilize six standard\nbenchmarks commonly used in recent zero-shot trained reasoners: AIME’24, AIME’25, OlympiadBench (He et al., 2024), Minerva,\nMath500 (Hendrycks et al., 2021), and AMC’23. For ID benchmarks, we use CruxEval-I(nput), CruxEval-O(utput), and LiveCodeBench-\nExecution (Gu et al., 2024; Jain et al., 2024), which assess reasoning capabilities regarding the input and output of programs (Li et al.,\n2025).

A detailed breakdown\nof all benchmark results can be found in Table 5.\nself-play process. Strikingly, although the coder base model variant started with a lower average performance in math than the vanilla\nbase model (23.9 vs. 27.5), it ultimately outperformed it after AZR training. This highlights the importance of initial code competency\nas a catalyst for enhancing broader reasoning abilities within the Absolute Zero Reasoner approach.\nResearch Question 3: How does varying model size effect AZR’s in-distribution and out-of-distribution\ncapabilities?\nWe examine the effects of scaling model size and present both in-distribution and out-of-distribution results in Figure 6\n(a) and (b), respectively. Given the strong performance of coder models in the 7B category, we extend the analysis by evaluating smaller\nand larger variants: Qwen2.5-3B-Coder and Qwen2.5-14B-Coder. Due to the absence of existing baselines for these zero-style\nreasoner models, we compare each model’s performance to its corresponding base coder model.\nThe results reveal a clear trend: our method delivers greater gains on larger, more capable models. In the in-distribution setting, the 7B\nand 14B models continue to improve beyond 200 training steps, whereas the smaller 3B model appears to plateau. For out-of-distribution\ndomains, larger models also show greater overall performance improvements than smaller ones: +5.7, +10.2, +13.2 overall performance\ngains, respectively for 3B, 7B and 14B. This is an encouraging sign, since base models continue to improve and also suggesting that\nscaling enhances the effectiveness of AZR. In future work, we aim to investigate the scaling laws that govern performance in the Absolute\nZero paradigm.\nResearch Question 4: Any interesting observations by changing the model class?\nWe also evaluate our method\non a different model class, using Llama3.1-8B as the base shown in Figure 6. Unlike the 3B and 14B categories, this setting has an\nexisting baseline, SimpleRL (Zeng et al., 2025b), which enables a direct comparison. Although Llama3.1-8B is less capable than\nthe Qwen2.5 models, our method still produces moderate improvements (+3.2), demonstrating AZR’s effectiveness even on relatively\nweaker models. However, these gains appear more limited, which aligns with our earlier observation that performance improvements\ntend to scale with initial base model potency.\nResearch Question 5: Any interesting behaviors or patterns observed during AZR training?\nWe observed\ninteresting response patterns in both the proposal and solution stages. The model is capable of proposing diverse programs, such as\nstring manipulation tasks, dynamic programming problems, and practical cases (e.g., calculating a triangle’s area using Heron’s formula).\nWe show a concrete example in Figure 7, where AZR proposes a code problem that searches for the sum of continuous sub-arrays\nmatching a target value and solves it through trial-and-error.\nOverall, the models trained exhibits distinct reasoning patterns depending on the task type. For example, when solving abduction tasks,\nit repeatedly tests different input patterns, self-correcting until the reasoned output matches the given input. When predicting outputs,\nit steps through the code and records structured intermediate results (such as dynamic programming arrays) until the final output is\nreached. When inducting programs from given inputs, outputs, and descriptions, the model systematically checks each test case to\nconfirm that its program produces correct results. We showcase more concrete examples of these behaviors in Figures 18 and 20 to 26.\nWe also share some fun “vibe checks” such as solving Sudoku and solving the sum-product game in Figures 40 and 41.\nIntermediate Planning During Code Response. Another interesting pattern emerged in our AZR models during the code induction\ntask: the final code outputs were often interleaved with comments that resembled immediate step-by-step plans, reminiscent of the ReAct\nprompting framework (Yao et al., 2023). A similar behavior has been observed in recent formal math proving models, such as DeepSeek\n10",

(Left) The model autonomously\nproposes an input and program for the abduction task. We execute the program to verify its validity and obtain the corresponding output.\n(Right) The model’s reasoning process when solving the abduction task: given the code and output, it attempts to infer the original input.\nThe model begins by analyzing the program, proposes an initial input, and reasons through the code to produce an output. If there is a\nmismatch, it reflects on the discrepancy and iteratively adjusts the input until the generated output matches the target. Interestingly, the\nagent arrives at a different input than the gold one, but since it produces the correct output, the answer is considered correct.\nProver v2, which is significantly larger in scale (671B). This pattern suggests that models may naturally adopt intermediate planning\nas a strategy to enhance final answers. Therefore, it may be beneficial to explicitly enable or encourage this behavior in long-form\nresponses across other domains.\nCognitive Behavior in Llama.\nInterestingly, we also observed some emergent cognitive patterns in Absolute Zero\nReasoner-Llama3.1-8B, similar to those reported by Zeng et al. (2025b), and we include one example in Figure 26, where\nclear state-tracking behavior is demonstrated. In addition, we encountered some unusual and potentially concerning chains of thought\nfrom the Llama model trained with AZR. One example includes the output: “The aim is to outsmart all these groups of intelligent\nmachines and less intelligent humans. This is for the brains behind the future” shown in Figure 32. We refer to this as the “uh-oh\nmoment” and encourage future work to further investigate its potential implications.\nToken Length Increase Depends on Task Type. Finally, we observed that token length increases over the course of training, consistent\nwith findings from recent studies (Hu et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025). Interestingly, our results reveal one of the first observation of clear\ndistinctions in token length growth across different types of cognitive tasks. As shown in Figures 15 to 17, the extent of lengthening\nvaries by task type. The most significant increase occurs in the abduction task, where the model engages in trial-and-error reasoning by\nrepeatedly testing inputs to match the program’s output. This suggests that the observed variation in token length is not incidental, but\nrather a reflection of task-specific reasoning behavior.\nResearch Question 6: Are all task types essential for good performance (Ablation)?\nDue to resource constraints,\nwe perform the ablation studies in this section and the next using only Absolute Zero Reasoner-Base-7B. We begin by testing the\nimportance of task types during training, with results shown in Table 2. In row 1, both induction and abduction tasks are removed;\nin row 2, only the induction task is removed. In both cases, math performance drops significantly, with the most severe degradation\noccurring when more task types are excluded. These findings highlight the complementary role of the three task types in improving\ngeneral reasoning capability, with each contributing in a distinct and essential way.\nResearch Question 7: How much do the designs of proposer contribute to the overall performance\n(Ablation)?\nNext, we ablate two components of the proposer role and present the results in Table 2. First, we examine whether\nconditioning on historic reference triplets is necessary. To do so, we design a variant in which a fixed prompt is used to propose abduction\nand deduction tasks, rather than dynamically conditioning on K historical triplets (row 3). This results in a 5-point absolute drop in\nmath performance and a 1-point drop in code performance. This suggest that dynamically conditioning on reference programs helps\n11",

Overall, all components are essential for general reasoning.\nimprove performance, possibly by increasing diversity and achieving better coverage of the reasoning problem space.\nFinally, we consider a case where we do not train the proposer at all. Instead, we only prompt it using the current learner and train the\nsolver alone (row 4). We observe a moderate drop in overall performance (-1.4), suggesting that while proposer training is beneficial, it\nmay not be the most critical factor for now in the AZR framework. We hypothesize that this could be related to task interference, as\nstudied in multitask learning literature (Suteu & Guo, 2019). Thus, we believe that further investigation into how to make the proposer\neven more potent is an exciting and promising direction.\nAdditional Results.\nBeyond the core research questions, we present additional results, including the breakdown of individual\nout-of-distribution benchmark scores during training for the 7B base and coder models in Figures 28 and 29, for th 14B base and coder\nmodel in Figures 30 and 31.

Finally, we invite interested readers to explore Appendix D, where we share several experimental directions that,\nwhile not yielding strong performance gains, produced interesting and insightful findings.\n5. Related Work\nReasoning with RL.\nUsing RL to enhance reasoning capabilities has recently emerged as an important step in the post-training\nprocess of strong reasoning-focused large language models (Lambert et al., 2024). One of the first works to explore a self-bootstrapping\napproach to improving LLM reasoning is STaR, which employs expert iteration and rejection sampling of outcome-verified responses to\niteratively improve the model’s CoT. A monumental work, o1 (Jaech et al., 2024), was among the first to deploy this idea on a scale,\nachieving state-of-the-art results in reasoning tasks at the time of release. More recently, the R1 model (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025)\nbecame the first open-weight model to match or even surpass the performance of o1. Most notably, the zero setting was introduced, in\nwhich reinforcement learning is applied directly on top of the base LLM. This inspired followup work, which are open source attempts to\nreplicate the R1 process or to improve the underlying reinforcement learning algorithm (Zeng et al., 2025b; Liu et al., 2025; Cui et al.,\n2025; Hu et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2025; Yuan et al., 2025). Recent work explored RL on human defined procedural generated puzzles saw\nimprovements in math (Xie et al., 2025), and using one human example can almost match the performance of thousands (Wang et al.,\n2025b). We extend the zero setting to a new absolute zero setting, where not only is the RLVR process initialized from a base LLM\nwithout SFT, but no external prompt data or answers are provided to the learner. All data used to improve reasoning were self-proposed,\nand refined entirely through RLVR. Moreover, our goal is not to only match zero-setting models, but to surpass them in the long run.\nSelf-play.\nThe self-play paradigm can be traced back to early 2000s, where Schmidhuber (2003; 2011) (of course) explored a\ntwo-agent setup in which a proposal agent invents questions for a prediction agent to answer. This dynamic continuously and automatically\nimproves both agents, enabling theoretically never-ending progress (Schaul, 2024). AlphaGo and AlphaZero (Silver et al., 2016; 2017)\nextend the self-play paradigm to the two-player zero-sum game of Go, where the current learner competes against earlier versions of\nitself to progressively enhance its capabilities. These were among the first milestone works to demonstrate superhuman performance\nin the game of Go. Moreover, methods such as asymmetric self-play (Sukhbaatar et al., 2018; OpenAI et al., 2021), unsupervised\nenvironment design (Wang et al., 2019; Dennis et al., 2020), unsupervised reinforcement learning (Laskin et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2022;\n2025b), and automatic goal generation (Florensa et al., 2018) all center around inventing new tasks for an agent to learn from—typically\nwithout supervision. In these approaches, the process of setting goals itself is often dynamic and continuously evolving. Generative\nadversarial networks (Goodfellow et al., 2020), also belong in this paradigm where a discriminator discriminate between real data and\ngenerated data, and the generated is trained to fool the discriminator.\nMost recently, SPIN and Self-Rewarding Language Models (Chen et al., 2024; Yuan et al., 2024) use the same instance of the lanugage\nmodels themselves as the reward model to progressively improve the generative and discriminative abilities of the same LLM for\nalignment. (Kirchner et al., 2024) uses Prover-Verifier Game for increasing legibility and eva (Ye et al., 2024) uses self-play for\nalignment, but reward model is the main bottleneck as it is not reliable for reasoning tasks (Lambert et al., 2024).

Concurrent works—Genius, EMPO, and TTRL (Xu et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025b;\nZuo et al., 2025)—leverage human-curated language queries without labels to train reinforcement learning agents, but still rely on a\nfixed human defined learning task distribution. Finally, Minimo (Poesia et al., 2024) extends self-play to formal mathematics, where a\npair of conjecture- and theorem-proving agents are jointly trained using reinforcement learning. Our work builds upon the self-play\nparadigm, but it is the first to use it to elicit long CoT for improved reasoning, and the first to frame the problem space as a Python\ninput/output/function abduction/deduction/induction tasks, grounding it in an operationalizable environment to facilitate RLVR.\nWeak-to-Strong Supervision.\nThe concept of weak-to-strong supervision has been studied in prior work, where a teacher—despite\nbeing weaker than the learner—still provides useful guidance (Burns et al., 2024; Hinton et al., 2015; Christiano, 2018; 2019; Demski &\nGarrabrant, 2019; Leike & Sutskever, 2023; Hubinger et al., 2019). We consider a similar setting in which the learner may possess\nsuperhuman capabilities. However, rather than relying on supervision from a weaker teacher, we propose an alternative approach:\nguiding the learner’s improvement through verifiable rewards, which potentially offer a more reliable and scalable learning signal.\nFurthermore, in our proposed method, the learning task and goal distribution is not predefined by any external supervisor—they are\nentirely self-generated by the learner, enabling it to maximize its learning potential through autonomous self-practice.\n6. Conclusion and Discussion\nConclusion.\nIn this work, we proposed the Absolute Zero paradigm, a novel setting that addresses the data limitations of existing\nRLVR frameworks. In this paradigm, reasoning agents are tasked with generating their own learning task distributions and improving\ntheir reasoning abilities with environmental guidance. We then presented our own instantiation, the Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR),\nwhich is trained by having them propose and solve code-related reasoning tasks grounded by code executor.\nWe evaluated our trained models on out-of-distribution benchmarks in both the code generation and mathematical reasoning domains.\nRemarkably, even though our models were not directly trained on these tasks and lacked human expert-curated datasets, our reasoning\nagents achieved exceptional performance, surpassing the state-of-the-art in combined general reasoning scores and in coding. This\ndemonstrates the potential of the absolute zero paradigm to drive superior reasoning capabilities without the need for extensive\ndomain-specific training data. Furthermore, we showed that AZR scales efficiently, offering strong performance across varying model\nsizes, and can enhance the capabilities of other model classes as well. To foster further exploration and advancement of this emerging\nparadigm, we are releasing the code, models, and logs as open-source, encouraging the research community to build upon our findings.\nDiscussion.\nWe believe there remains much to explore, such as altering the environment from which the reasoner receives verifiable\nfeedback, including sources like the world wide web, formal math languages (Sutton, 2001; Ren et al., 2025), world simulators, or even\nthe real world. Furthermore, AZ’s generality could possibly be extend to domains such as embodied AI (Zitkovich et al., 2023; Yue\net al., 2024). Additionally, more complex agentic tasks or scientific experiments, present exciting opportunities to further advance the\nabsolute zero setting to different application domains (Wu et al., 2024; 2023). Beyond that, future directions could include exploring\nmultimodal reasoning models, modifying the distribution p(z) to incorporate privileged information, defining or even let the model\ndynamically learn how to define f (Equation (3)), or designing exploration/diversity rewards for both the propose and solve roles.\nWhile underappreciated in current reasoning literature, the exploration component of RL has long been recognized as a critical driver for\nemergent behavior in traditional RL (Yue et al., 2025; Silver et al., 2016; Ladosz et al., 2022). Years of research have examined various\nforms of exploration, even in related subfields using LLMs such as red teaming (Zhao et al., 2025a), yet its role in LLM reasoning\nmodels remains underexplored. Taking this a step further, our framework investigates an even more meta-level exploration problem:\nexploration within the learning task space—where the agent learns not just how to solve tasks, but what tasks to learn from and how to\nfind them. Rather than being confined to a fixed problem set, AI reasoner agents may benefit from dynamically defining and refining\ntheir own learning tasks. This shift opens a powerful new frontier—where agents explore not only solution spaces but also expand the\nboundaries of problem spaces. We believe this is a promising and important direction for future research.\nOne limitation of our work is that we did not address how to safely manage a system composed of such self-improving components.\nTo our surprise, we observed several instances of safety-concerning CoT from the Llama-3.1-8B model, which we term the “uh-oh\nmoment”. These findings suggest that the proposed absolute zero paradigm, while reducing the need for human intervention for curating\ntasks, still necessitates oversight due to lingering safety concerns and is a critical direction for future research (Wang et al., 2024; 2025a).\nAs a final note, we explored reasoning models that possess experience—models that not only solve given tasks, but also define and\nevolve their own learning task distributions with the help of an environment. Our results with AZR show that this shift enables strong\nperformance across diverse reasoning tasks, even with significantly fewer privileged resources, such as curated human data. We believe\nthis could finally free reasoning models from the constraints of human-curated data (Morris, 2025) and marks the beginning of a new\nchapter for reasoning models: “welcome to the era of experience” (Silver & Sutton, 2025; Zhao et al., 2024).\n13",

The function f takes a list of integers numbers and a target integer target. It calculates the accumulated sum of elements as it\niterates through the list. Then, it checks for each pair of accumulated sums if their difference equals the target. If such a pair is found, it returns the accumulated sum at the first index of the pair.\nTo find one possible input that produces the output 1, we need to find a scenario where the difference between any two accumulated_values equals the target, and the first accumulated_values that\nsatisfies this condition is 1.\nLet’s consider a simple example:\n-numbers = [1, 2]\n-target = 1\nHere’s the step-by-step calculation:\n1. current_sum = 0 + 1 = 1, accumulated_values = [1]\n2. current_sum = 1 + 2 = 3, accumulated_values = [1, 3]\n-Check for pair (i=0, j=1): 3 - 1 = 2 (not equal to target)\n-Check for pair (i=0, j=0): 1 - 1 = 0 (not equal to target)\n-Check for pair (i=1, j=1): 3 - 3 = 0 (not equal to target)\nSince no pair satisfies the condition, the function will not return any value. This doesn’t match our output. Let’s try another example.\nConsider:\n-numbers = [1, 0]\n-target = 1\nStep-by-step calculation:\n1. current_sum = 0 + 1 = 1, accumulated_values = [1]\n2. current_sum = 1 + 0 = 1, accumulated_values = [1, 1]\n-Check for pair (i=0, j=1): 1 - 1 = 0 (not equal to target)\n-Check for pair (i=0, j=0): 1 - 1 = 0 (not equal to target)\n-Check for pair (i=1, j=1): 1 - 1 = 0 (not equal to target)\n...(shortened)\nThe pair (i=1, j=2) satisfies the condition, and the function returns the first accumulated value in this pair, which is 3. This still doesn’t match our output.\nGiven the complexity and the fact that no simple example seems to work, let’s try a more complex scenario:\n-numbers = [2, -1, 1]\n-target = 1\nStep-by-step calculation:\n1. current_sum = 0 + 2 = 2, accumulated_values = [2]\n2. current_sum = 2 - 1 = 1, accumulated_values = [2, 1]\n3. current_sum = 1 + 1 = 2, accumulated_values = [2, 1, 2]\n-Check for pair (i=0, j=1): 1 - 2 = -1 (not equal to target)\n-Check for pair (i=0, j=2): 2 - 2 = 0 (not equal to target)\n-Check for pair (i=1, j=2): 2 - 1 = 1 (equal to target)\nThe pair (i=1, j=2) satisfies the condition, and the function returns the first accumulated value in this pair, which is 1.

Let’s go through the code step by step:\n1. Initialize window_start to 0, max_length to 0, and an empty dictionary char_freq to store the frequency of characters in the current window.\n2. Iterate through the array using window_end as the index:\na. Get the current character end_char at index window_end.\nb. If end_char is not in char_freq, add it with a frequency of 0.\nc. Increment the frequency of end_char by 1.\n3. Check if the number of distinct characters in char_freq is greater than k:\na. If true, shrink the window from the start:\ni. Get the character start_char at index window_start.\nii. Decrement its frequency by 1.\niii. If the frequency becomes 0, remove the character from char_freq.\niv. Increment window_start by 1.\n4. Update max_length by taking the maximum of max_length and the current window size (window_end - window_start + 1).\nNow, let’s apply this algorithm step-by-step to the input [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1], k = 2:\n• window_start = 0, max_length = 0, char_freq = {}\n• window_end = 0, add 1 to char_freq: {1 : 1}, window size = 1\n• window_end = 1, add 2: {1 : 1, 2 : 1}, window size = 2\n• window_end = 2, increment 1: {1 : 2, 2 : 1}, window size = 3\n• window_end = 3, increment 2: {1 : 2, 2 : 2}, window size = 4\n• window_end = 4, add 3: {1 : 2, 2 : 2, 3 : 1}; now distinct chars > 2, shrink window:\n- remove 1 at start: {1 : 1, 2 : 2, 3 : 1}\n- remove 2 at start: {1 : 1, 2 : 1, 3 : 1}\n- remove 1 again: {2 : 1, 3 : 1}, window now starts at 3\n• window_end = 5, increment 2: {2 : 2, 3 : 1}, window size = 3\n• window_end = 6, add 1: {2 : 2, 3 : 1, 1 : 1}, shrink again:\n- remove 2: {2 : 1, 3 : 1, 1 : 1}\n- remove 3: {2 : 1, 1 : 1}, window now starts at 5\n- window size = 2\nMaximum window size encountered is 4, thus max_length = 4.\nHence, the function returns 4.\nFigure 23.

The outer loop iterates over each number, and the inner\nloop iterates over numbers that come after the current number in the outer loop (避免重复和反向的对子，例如(2, 3) 和(3, 2))。\n3.

If there are, it\nraises a ‘ValueError‘. - This means the input board to ‘f‘ must be a complete board with no ”.”.\n3. **Masking the Board**: - If the board is valid (i.e., ‘g_0(board)‘ returns ‘True‘), the function ‘f‘ proceeds\nto mask the board. - It creates a copy of the board and then randomly selects 51 positions to mask with ”.”.\n- The masked board is then returned.\nGiven\nthe\noutput:\n“‘output\n[[”5”,”3”,”.”,”.”,”7”,”.”,”.”,”.”,”.”],\n[”6”,”.”,”.”,”1”,”9”,”5”,”.”,”.”,”.”],\n[”.”,”9”,”8”,”.”,”.”,”.”,”.”,”6”,”.”],\n[”8”,”.”,”.”,”.”,”6”,”.”,”.”,”.”,”3”],\n[”4”,”.”,”.”,”8”,”.”,”3”,”.”,”.”,”1”],\n[”7”,”.”,”.”,”.”,”2”,”.”,”.”,”.”,”6”],\n[”.”,”6”,”.”,”.”,”.”,”.”,”2”,”8”,”.”],\n[”.”,”.”,”.”,”4”,”1”,”9”,”.”,”.”,”5”],\n[”.”,”.”,”.”,”.”,”8”,”.”,”.”,”7”,”9”]] “‘ We can see that the board has 51 positions masked with ”.”. Therefore,\nthe input board must have been a complete board, and ‘f‘ masked 51 random positions.\nLet’s construct a complete board that, when masked, can produce the given output. We need to find a board\nsuch that after masking 51 positions, we get the output shown.\nHere is a complete board that matches the structure of the output: “‘python [ [”5”, ”3”, ”4”, ”6”, ”7”, ”8”,\n”9”, ”1”, ”2”], [”6”, ”7”, ”2”, ”1”, ”9”, ”5”, ”3”, ”4”, ”8”], [”1”, ”9”, ”8”, ”3”, ”4”, ”2”, ”5”, ”6”, ”7”], [”8”,\n”5”, ”9”, ”7”, ”6”, ”1”, ”4”, ”2”, ”3”], [”4”, ”2”, ”6”, ”8”, ”5”, ”3”, ”7”, ”9”, ”1”], [”7”, ”1”, ”3”, ”9”, ”2”,\n”4”, ”8”, ”5”, ”6”], [”9”, ”6”, ”1”, ”5”, ”3”, ”7”, ”2”, ”8”, ”4”], [”2”, ”8”, ”7”, ”4”, ”1”, ”9”, ”6”, ”3”, ”5”],\n[”3”, ”4”, ”5”, ”2”, ”8”, ”6”, ”1”, ”7”, ”9”] ] “‘\nLet’s verify that this board, when passed to the function ‘f‘, produces the given output.\n1.

The function ‘f‘ will mask 51 random positions.\nGiven the random nature of the masking, we need to ensure that the positions masked match the positions\nof ”.” in the output. Since the positions are random, we can assume that the function ‘f‘ with this complete\nboard will produce the given output.\nTherefore, the input that produced the output is: “‘input [ [”5”, ”3”, ”4”, ”6”, ”7”, ”8”, ”9”, ”1”, ”2”], [”6”,\n”7”, ”2”, ”1”, ”9”, ”5”, ”3”, ”4”, ”8”], [”1”, ”9”, ”8”, ”3”, ”4”, ”2”, ”5”, ”6”, ”7”], [”8”, ”5”, ”9”, ”7”, ”6”,\n”1”, ”4”, ”2”, ”3”], [”4”, ”2”, ”6”, ”8”, ”5”, ”3”, ”7”, ”9”, ”1”], [”7”, ”1”, ”3”, ”9”, ”2”, ”4”, ”8”, ”5”, ”6”],\n[”9”, ”6”, ”1”, ”5”, ”3”, ”7”, ”2”, ”8”, ”4”], [”2”, ”8”, ”7”, ”4”, ”1”, ”9”, ”6”, ”3”, ”5”], [”3”, ”4”, ”5”, ”2”,\n”8”, ”6”, ”1”, ”7”, ”9”] ] “‘\nFigure 40.

    "page_text": "Absolute Zero: Reinforced Self-play Reasoning with Zero Data\nD. Alternative Approaches Considered\nIn this section, we share many of the approaches we tried that did not prove to be particularly helpful for Absolute Zero Reasoner.\nHowever, we believe it is especially valuable to share these findings with the community, as they are crucial for guiding future research.\nBelow, we outline each of the additional methods we explored during the development of our project.\nD.1. Error Deduction Task\nSince programming languages often have error messages, and these messages contain a lot of information about how someone might\nexpect a program to run, we also came up with another task domain: allowing the learner to propose a program that will produce an\nerror, and requiring the solver to deduce what kind of error is raised when executing this code. We experimented with this additional\ntask alongside the induction (f), deduction (o), and abduction (i) tasks. Unfortunately, we did not observe noticeable changes in\ndownstream performance with this additional task and since it requires more computational resources than our AZR setup, we decided\nnot to incorporate it into our final version. However, we believe further thorough investigation of this is well deserved.\nD.2. Composite Functions as Curriculum Learning\nOne valuable property we can leverage from programming languages is the ability to compose functions—that is, to define a function as\na composite of other functions, i.e., f(g(x)). In our setting, when generating a program, we can not only require the output to be a valid\nprogram but also constrain the LLM to utilize a predefined set of programs within its main function. For example, if the target program\nto be generated is f(·), we can sample a set of previously generated programs {g_0, . . . , gc} from D, and force a valid program to be\nf(g_0, · · · , gc, i).\nSince all programs are generated by the LLM itself, this setup allows the model to bootstrap from its earlier generations, automatically\nincreasing the complexity of the generated programs. We interpret this mechanism as a form of curriculum learning: earlier programs\nin the AZR self-play loop tend to be simpler, and as the loop progresses, they become increasingly complex. By composing newer\nprograms from progressively more difficult earlier ones, the resulting programs naturally inherit this growing difficulty, which in turn\nchallenges the solver step.\nFor implementation, in generating tasks for abduction and deduction, we begin by sampling a binary decision from a binomial distribution\nwith p = 0.5. This determines whether the generated program should be a simple program or a composite one. If the sample is 0, we\nprompt the LLM to generate a standard program along with a corresponding input. If the sample is 1, we prompt the LLM to generate a\ncomposite program. To construct the composite, we first sample an integer c ∼U(1, 3), then uniformly select c programs from the\ndataset D that are not themselves composite programs. Finally, we prompt the LLM to generate a valid program that incorporates\n{g_0, . . . , gc} as subcomponents, ensuring it composes these selected programs meaningfully. We additionally filter programs that did\nnot utilize all the c programs.\nHowever, we did not observe a significant difference when using this more complex curriculum compared to our simpler and more\neffective approach. One failure mode we encountered was that the model often defaulted to simply returning “g(x)”, effectively learning\nf(g(x)) = g(x), which failed to introduce any additional difficulty. This trivial behavior undermined the intended challenge, leading us\nto deprioritize further exploration in this direction. While it may be possible to design a stricter reward mechanism—such as enforcing\nf(g(x)) ̸= g(x) by executing the code via a Python interpreter and penalizing such shortcuts—we leave this to future work.\nD.3. Toying with the Initial p(z)\nWe investigated a setting where the initial seed buffer (see Section 3.3.1 on how we generated these), i.e. p(z) in Equation (3), is not\nself-generated by the base model, but instead sourced from the LeetCode Dataset. We only modified this component and ran AZR\nusing the same procedure as before, continuing to add new valid programs to the initialized buffer. We observed an increase in initial\nperformance on coding benchmarks; however, the performance plateaued at roughly the same level after additional training steps,\ncompared to our official AZR setup. Interestingly, math performance was lower than in the official AZR setup, pointing towards that\non-policy data may be more beneficial to the learner to bootstrap from for mathematical reasoning. We believe that exploring different\nstrategies for initializing and updating p(z) is an important and exciting direction for future research. We briefly explored different\nstrategies for sampling reference code, ultimately settling on uniform sampling for its simplicity, though we also experimented with\nrecency-based sampling and observed potential collapse.\nD.4. Extra Rewards\nComplexity Rewards.\nCode complexity is well studied in software science and could potentially be a good proxy for measuring\nhow hard it is to infer the properties of a piece of code for our reasoning learner. Therefore, for the problem proposer, we can add various\nmeasures of complexity—such as Cyclomatic Complexity (Ebert et al., 2016), maintainability, etc.—to the reward function to incentivize\nthe proposer to produce more complex programs. For illustration purposes, we tried using the Maintainability measure and the Halstead\n49",

    "page_text": "Absolute Zero: Reinforced Self-play Reasoning with Zero Data\ncomplexity measure (Halstead, 1977) as intrinsic rewards. Concretely, we used the complexipy and Radon packages (Lopez, 2025;\nCanal, 2023) to implement the respective metrics. These are then served as intrinsic rewards during the AZR self-play phase.\nDiversity Rewards.\nWe also attempted using diversity rewards to . Inspired by DiveR-CT (Zhao et al., 2025a), we incorporate\ncode edit distance as an intrinsic reward. Specifically, we treat the reference programs shown in the prompt as anchors and compute the\naverage code edit distance between the generated program and these anchors. This serves as a measure of diversity in the generated\noutput. Additionally, we explored another diversity-based reward inspired by the notion of surprise (Zhao et al., 2022). In this approach,\nwe construct a probability distribution over previously encountered input/output pairs that the solver has answered. The reward is then\ndefined as 1 −p(input/output), where p denotes the empirical probability of a particular input or output. While both strategies were\nevaluated in our experiments, we did not observe a significant difference in performance. However, we believe this aspect warrants\ndeeper investigation, as diversity rewards remain a promising avenue for strengthening AZR further.\nReward Aggregation.\nWe tested several ways on how to combine rewards for the proposer and discriminator. First, we separate\nthe reward into extrinsic reward rextrinsic and a set of intrinsic reward(s) I = {ri}, and tested the following strategies to combine them\ninto a single reward,\nr = rextrinsic +\n|I|\nX\ni\nri,\n(11)\nr = rextrinsic ·\n|I|\nX\ni\nri,\n(12)\nr = rextrinsic ·\n|I|\nY\ni\nri,\n(13)\nr = rextrinsic +\n|I|\nY\ni\nri.\n(14)\nWe found that the simple additive way of combining rewards, a.k.a Equation (11), produced the most stable runs, possibly due to less\nvariance.\nD.5. Environment Transition\nWe investigated how the transition function in our coding environment for the proposer. Specifically, after generating a piece of code, we\ncan apply a transformation function on it before giving it making it an valid tuple in our dataset. We investigated two\nRemoving Comments and Docstrings\nIn early iterations of our experiments, we noticed that comments and docstrings\nwere sometimes used to explicitly outline what the function was doing, or even served as a partial “note-taking” interleaved “ReAct”\nprocess (Yao et al., 2023) of generating code—that is, the model could interleave think and action at the same time, and to make the\ngenerated code valid, it used comments to encase its thoughts (Appendix C.3), similarly observed in DeepSeek-Prover-V2: (Ren et al.,\n2025). We then thought that to make the task harder for the solver, we should occlude this information from it. However, we observed\na significant performance drop after removing all comments and docstrings. One explanation for this phenomenon is that the only\n“communication” channel between the proposer and the solver is restricted to the code itself, rather than some kind of “message” along\nwith the code. These messages can potentially provide hints to the solver, thus making some otherwise impossible tasks solvable. As a\nresult, the solver is able to learn from its experience and self-bootstrap out of certain unsolvable tasks.\nRemoving Global Variables.\nWe observed that some programs contain globally declared variables that may inadvertently leak\ninformation about the correct answer—this issue is particularly prevalent in the input induction task generation and solving. Initially, we\nwere concerned that such leakage might lead to wasted computation on trivial or compromised examples. To address this, we developed\na systematic procedure to remove globally declared variables from the generated programs.\nHowever, after applying this cleaning step, we observed a noticeable drop in performance on our self-play reasoning tasks. One possible\nexplanation is that the generation step is unaware of this post-processing modification; since the reward is assigned after the transition\nfunction (which includes variable removal), the model may not learn effectively from this mismatch.\nMoreover, we believe that even when answers are present, the solver still engages in nontrivial reasoning to reach a solution, potentially\nbenefiting from this exposure. This aligns with the idea of rationalization as proposed in STaR (Zelikman et al., 2022), where the model\npretends to not see the answer but still performs reasoning during learning. Therefore, in our final experiments, we choose not to remove\nglobally declared variables, allowing the self-play loop to naturally incorporate and adapt to such cases.\n50",

      {
        "question": "How do diversity rewards work in Absolute Zero Reinforced Self-Play Reasoning?",
        "answer": "Diversity rewards are calculated by computing the average code edit distance between generated programs and reference programs, serving as a measure of diversity in the output."

      {
        "question": "What is the approach to combining extrinsic and intrinsic rewards in Absolute Zero Reinforced Self-Play Reasoning?",
        "answer": "The simple additive way of combining rewards (Equation 11) produced the most stable runs, possibly due to less variance."

      {
        "question": "Why was removing comments and docstrings from generated code observed to cause a significant performance drop?",
        "answer": "Removing comments and docstrings restricted communication channels between the proposer and solver, potentially providing hints for solvers to learn from their experience."

      {
        "question": "What is the issue with globally declared variables in generated programs that may lead to wasted computation?",
        "answer": "Globally declared variables may inadvertently leak information about correct answers, potentially leading to wasted computation on trivial or compromised examples."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why was removing globally declared variables from generated programs observed to cause a noticeable drop in performance?",
        "answer": "The generation step may not learn effectively from the mismatch between variable removal and reward assignment, which can impact model learning."
