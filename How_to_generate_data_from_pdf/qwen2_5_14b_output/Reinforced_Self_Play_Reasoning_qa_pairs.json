    "question": "What intrinsic rewards are used in AZR for complexity?",
    "answer": "AZR uses the Halstead complexity measure as an intrinsic reward, implemented using the complexipy and Radon packages (see Reinforced_Self_Play_Reasoning page:50)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does AZR incorporate diversity rewards?",
    "answer": "AZR incorporates code edit distance as a diversity reward, inspired by DiveR-CT. Additionally, it explores another approach based on the notion of surprise (see Reinforced_Self_Play_Reasoning page:50)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the strategies tested for combining rewards in AZR?",
    "answer": "AZR tests several reward aggregation methods including additive and multiplicative combinations, finding that Equation (11) produces the most stable results due to less variance (see Reinforced_Self_Play_Reasoning page:50)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of removing comments and docstrings in AZR?",
    "answer": "Removing comments and docstrings was intended to make tasks harder for the solver, but this led to a significant performance drop, suggesting that such information can provide useful hints (see Reinforced_Self_Play_Reasoning page:50)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is removing global variables problematic in AZR?",
    "answer": "Removing globally declared variables caused a noticeable drop in performance because the model may not learn effectively from this mismatch, and such exposure can benefit nontrivial reasoning (see Reinforced_Self_Play_Reasoning page:50)."
